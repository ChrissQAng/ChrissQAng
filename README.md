Hello to everyone,
My name is Chriss and I want to start a new career in IT.
My best and most important projects are silentMoon, where I coded almost the whole backend, zwitscher and free2game!
Skills & Technologies: ReactJS | jQuery | JavaScript ES6+ | Tailwind CSS | SASS/SCSS | CSS | HTML | Git | GitHub | Command Line | Node.js. | Express.js | MongoDB
My latest project is coded with VUE, so I extended my skills!
